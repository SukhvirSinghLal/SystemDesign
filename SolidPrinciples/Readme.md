# SOLID Principles in Software Design

## Overview
This repository contains examples and explanations of the SOLID principles in software design. The SOLID principles are a set of five design principles that help developers create more maintainable, flexible, and scalable software systems.

## Introduction
The SOLID principles were introduced by Robert C. Martin (Uncle Bob) as guidelines for writing better object-oriented code. They form the foundation for good software design and promote modular, maintainable, and reusable code. Understanding and applying these principles can lead to more robust software architectures and easier maintenance and evolution of systems.

## Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
The Single Responsibility Principle states that a class should have only one reason to change. In other words, a class should have only one responsibility or do only one thing.

## Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
The Open/Closed Principle states that software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension but closed for modification. This means that we should be able to extend the behavior of a module without modifying its source code.

## Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
The Liskov Substitution Principle states that objects of a superclass should be replaceable with objects of its subclasses without affecting the correctness of the program.

## Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
The Interface Segregation Principle states that a client should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use. It promotes the use of smaller, cohesive interfaces rather than large, monolithic ones.

## Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
The Dependency Inversion Principle states that high-level modules should not depend on low-level modules. Both should depend on abstractions. Additionally, abstractions should not depend on details; details should depend on abstractions.

## Examples
Examples demonstrating each SOLID principle in practice can be found in the respective sections of this repository.
