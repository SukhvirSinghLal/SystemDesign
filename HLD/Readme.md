## Introduction
The High-Level Design (HLD) document serves as a blueprint for the overall structure and organization of the project. It provides a high-level view of the system's architecture and design principles.

## Architecture Overview
Describe the architectural style/framework used in the project (e.g., monolithic, microservices, layered architecture) and justify the choice.

## Components
List and describe the major components/modules of the system, including their responsibilities, interfaces, and interactions.

## Data Flow
Illustrate the flow of data through the system, including inputs, processing, and outputs. Use diagrams or textual descriptions as appropriate.

## Interfaces
Document the interfaces exposed by the system, including APIs, user interfaces, and communication protocols.

## Deployment
Outline the deployment strategy for the project, including deployment environments (e.g., cloud, on-premises), infrastructure requirements, and deployment automation tools.

## Scalability
Discuss the system's scalability considerations, including horizontal and vertical scaling strategies, load balancing, and auto-scaling mechanisms.

## Reliability
Explain the measures taken to ensure the reliability of the system, such as fault tolerance, redundancy, and error handling.

## Security
Describe the security measures implemented in the system, including authentication, authorization, encryption, and data protection mechanisms.

## Dependencies
List and describe external dependencies used in the project, including libraries, frameworks, third-party services, and APIs.
