## Introduction
The Low-Level Design (LLD) document is intended for developers and technical stakeholders to understand the detailed design of the project. It complements the High-Level Design (HLD) document by providing specific implementation details.

## Class Diagram
Include the class diagram depicting the relationships between classes and their attributes/methods.

## Sequence Diagrams
Provide sequence diagrams illustrating the flow of interactions between various components/modules during specific use cases or scenarios.

## Component Details
Describe each component/module in detail, including its purpose, responsibilities, and interactions with other components.

## Data Structures
List and describe the data structures used in the project, including their implementation and usage.

## Algorithms
Document any algorithms implemented within the system, explaining their purpose and operation.

## Error Handling
Outline the error handling mechanisms employed within the system, including exception classes, error codes, and recovery strategies.

## Performance Considerations
Discuss any performance considerations, optimizations, or trade-offs made during the design phase.

## Dependencies
Enumerate the external dependencies used in the project, including libraries, frameworks, and third-party services.

Feel free to expand each section with relevant details specific to your project.
